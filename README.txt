## User Stories
This tip calculator app can calculate tips base on how user rates the service.
There are 4 categories of service rating such as, poor(5% tip), fair(10% tip),
good(15% tip), and excellent(20%). It can split the total bill including tips
up to 5 people. Also user can change the tips percentages for these 4 service

help button to instruct user how to use the app.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
It is my first iOS app even with the help of the video tutorial,
it is kind of challenging for me because when I want to implement something
I don't actually know how and where to look for it. I went online and looked at
a lot of tutorial but most of them were outdated or was using the old version of
xcode and swift which made really hard for me to follow and also took me very long
time to find the right one. For example, I didn't how to connect two view
controllers and passing data from one to another. Like the setting page,I want
to let user change the tip percentages but i don't know to update the change to
the first controller and don't know what is the technical term for that. It took
me more than 5 hours to figure out how to do it.
